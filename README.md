  ## Description
  Challenge 11 had us start by using the starter code given to us linked here:
  
  https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka
  
  With this code, were expected to implement express.js commands and functions to build a back end supporting the front end code. The resulting code
  can be found in this repository, and a link to a test site is listed under the usage section. If you would like to download the code and test it for
  yourself, instructions can be found on the installation section.
